# Pong

This is my first attempting at recreating the classic Pong. I did this to get an idea of what it means to actually make a game from scratch.

The primary challenge I encountered was proper collision detection.

This game is really easy to re-create. I recommend anyone to implement this from scratch as their first video game. Using basic concepts, you should be able to implement Pong in no time!
