# Pong

This is my first take on the classic Pong.
I enthusiastically built this in order to get an idea of what it means to actually make a video game from scratch.

The primary challenge was implementing proper collision detection.

This game is really easy to re-create. I recommend anyone to implement this from scratch as their first video game. Using basic concepts, you should be able to implement Pong in no time!
